        // Backtracking is a technique used to explore all possible solutions.
        // by trying out different choices and undoing when choice leads
        // to a dead end.

        // You have to choose the possiblities.
        // Recursive approch to explore further
        // if the condition met, store the result.
        // if the choice does not lead to solution., undo the last choice (backtract)
